## About This
This is the back-end server for [guilded super bot](https://github.com/Osamu01/superbot)

### Running this
This app runs independent of both the bot and client front-end (made in react)
This app will act simply as a REST API and websocket server.
Can be ran using `node app.js` or `nodemon app.js` during development.
Front-end uses react's proxy system to proxy api requests to this app.
